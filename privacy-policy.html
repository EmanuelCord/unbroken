            interaction between you and us.</li>
        <li>When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those
            applications or advertising include links to this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by us or any third party
            (including our affiliates and subsidiaries); or</li>
        <li>Any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content
            (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on our website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information. This is information which may be
        connected to you specifically as the individual to whom the information relates. Such information may include
        name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or any other information defined as personally
        identifiable information (or similar term) by applicable laws (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>).

        pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated and/or otherwise processed so as to be unidentifiable (i) in such a way

        longer be attributed to a specific individual (by reasonable means) without the use of additional information,
        and where such additional information is kept separate and under adequate security to prevent unauthorized
        re-identification of a specific individual such that one could not, using reasonable efforts, link such
        information back to a specific individual (the foregoing being referred to as <strong>“De-Identified Personal
        Information”</strong>).

    <ul>
        <li>These cookies are essential to allow you to browse our Website and use its functions. Without them, services such
            as shopping baskets and electronic invoicing would not be able to work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Performance Cookies</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>These cookies collect information on the use of our Website, such as which pages are consulted most often. This
            information enables us to optimize our Website and simplify browsing. Performance cookies also enable our affiliates
            and partners to find out whether you have accessed one of our websites from their site and whether your visit has
            led to the use or purchase of a product or service from our Website, including the references for the product or
            service purchased. These cookies do not collect any information which could be used to identify you. All the
            information collected is aggregated, and therefore anonymous.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>These cookies enable our Website to remember the choices you have made when browsing. For example, we can store
            your geographical location in a cookie so that the Website corresponding to your area is shown. We can also remember
            your preferences, such as the text size, font and other customizable aspects of the Website. Functionality cookies

            setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.
        </li>
        <li>Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and
            store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed

        <li>Web Beacons. Pages of our the Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also
            referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have
            visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the
            popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity)</li>
        <li>Pixel Tracking. In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ “pixel tracking”, a common process which may
            be used in connection with advertisements on other sites. Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not
            visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of
            advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A “pixel tag” is an invisible tag placed on
            certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user’s activity. We may access these pixel tags to
            identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods, services, and other offers with your
            interests and needs. For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag
            will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Website. If you visit our Website, and
            we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a
            third-party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.</li>
        <li>We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our
            emails.</li>
        <li>IP Address. Our servers automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you
            access the Services. These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Service you visited, your
            internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SECURITY</h2>
    <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
        access, use, alteration and disclosure. All personal information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers

    <p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (“EEA”)</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: This Privacy Policy originates and is hosted on a Website located in the United States, which has
        different data protection laws from those of other nations, and particularly member nations in the European Union.
        Due to differing laws and legal practice, be aware that law enforcement agencies in the United States may have
        access to your Personal Information.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>“GDPR”</strong>) will come into force on
        May 28, 2024 . While we take significant measures to protect privacy of your information, we are working toward
        ensuring that we are compliant with the GDPR rules by the time they become effective.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Transfer of data outside of the EEA
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>If you are a resident of country other than the United States, you acknowledge and consent to our collecting,
        transmitting, and storing your Personal Information out of the country in which you reside.
    </p>
    <p>We may transfer some or all of your personal information outside of the EEA. The privacy laws of the receiving
        country may be different from those in the EEA and may not have adequate data protection standards. We will always
        have appropriate safeguards in place when transferring your personal information outside of the EEA, and you may ask
        us for a copy of these safeguards.
    </p>
    <!--Rights-->
    <h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The right to be informed:</strong> You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable
            information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information
            in this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and other
            certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check
            that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You’re entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to erasure:</strong> This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to
            request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This
            is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When
            processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people
            who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in
            future.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across
            different services. Eg, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your
            information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to object:</strong> You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct
            marketing (which we do only with your consent). For more information or to object, see Objecting to processing.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rights of automated decision making and profiling:</strong> the GDPR has put in place safeguards to protect individuals
            against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is made without human intervention.
        </li>
    </ul>
